Mycrofarm 

This project developed an automated growing enclosure designed to help users grow plants despite common limitations like limited time, space, or experience. The enclosure continuously monitors and adjusts critical environmental factors—temperature, humidity, oxygen, and carbon dioxide—creating an ideal environment for plant growth. For our initial testing, we selected blue oyster mushrooms due to their ease of growth, rapid growth cycle, and high yield, allowing us to effectively assess the enclosure’s performance. By automating environmental control, this enclosure offers an accessible and efficient solution for home growing, making it possible for users to enjoy fresh produce with minimal effort.
